[Previously]({% post_url 2025-06-29-financing-during-the-civil-war %}) I discussed how the North mobilized resources during the American Civil War. Salmon P. Chase did one more thing which led to the establishment of the national banking system in 1863 during the war. The subsequent challenges brought on by the system paved the way for the Fed.

## National Banking System

Chase returned, for reasons I am yet to explore, to the idea of selling bonds. The bonds sold were of a special class with a 2% interest rate and a provision that these bonds could be used as collateral to allow banks to issue their own bank notes.


$$
\begin{array}{c@{\hskip 1cm}c@{\hskip 1cm}c}
\text{Govt.} &
\text{Banking System} \\
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
\text{+ deposits, G} & +2 \% \text{ bond} \\
 &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
+2 \% \text{ bond} & \text{+ deposits, G} \\
 &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$

The banks were willing to make this swap, at such low interest, because it allowed them to issue their own bank notes with no interest. Allowing the bank to pay deposits in their own bank notes. The following shows how the purchase of war goods occurred under this scheme,

$$
\begin{array}{c@{\hskip 1cm}c@{\hskip 1cm}c}
\text{Govt.} &
\text{Private Sector} &
\text{Banking System} \\
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
\text{- deposits, G} & +2 \% \text{ bond} \\
\text{+ war goods} &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
\text{+ bank notes} &  \\
\text{- war goods} &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
+2 \% \text{ bond} & \text{- deposits, G} \\
 & \text{+ bank notes} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$

Recognizing that now bank notes are promises to pay legal tender. Whenever the private sector wants to make a withdrawal, the bank pays in bank notes. Bank notes can be cashed even if the bank is bankrupt as it is backed by bonds. The main implication is that after 1863 there existed a fixed money supply due to legal tenders and notes which were promises to pay legal tender.

## Shortcomings of the National Banking System 

The shortcomings in the system arose from the fact that the US, at the time, was primarily an agricultural country. During harvest farmers would withdraw deposits (around $50 million). This required many of the country banks to withdraw their deposits, the majority of which were held in the big banks in New York and other reserve cities.

### How this led to seasonal instability 
1. Country farmers withdraw $50 million in cash
2. withdrawal of $50 million from New York banks 
3. Now below 25% reserve requirement (strictly enforced)
4. New York or other big banks needed to call in call loans to meet immediate liquidity needs. Call loans usually given to speculators (stocks). The speculators then were forced to sell their stocks causing stock prices to fall.
5. Stocks fell and interest rares rise 

It was this seasonal instability that ultimately motivated the creation of central bank.
