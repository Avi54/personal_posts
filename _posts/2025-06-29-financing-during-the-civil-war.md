In American monetary history, the creation of the Federal Reserve stands out as a monumental moment. To truly appreciate the importance and necessity of central banking, it is worth exploring the system that preceded the Fed. 
The period, prior to the Fed, was referred to as the National Banking System (1863-1913). The system was bereft with elasticity among other challenges that ultimately led to the creation of the Fed through the Federal Reserve Act. Before discussing the pre-Fed system I provide the context in which it emerged, namely the American Civil War.

## Civil War Financing
The system's origin and evolution is attached to the challenges brought on by the American Civil War. In any war, the governmentâ€™s top priority is to mobilize resources (war goods). To do so, they can either raise taxes or sell government bonds. One approach is to sell bonds to the private sector. 

$$
\text{Govt.}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
\text{+ deposits, G} & \text{+ bonds} \\
 &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

$$
\text{Private Sector}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
\text{+ bonds} &  \\
\text{- deposits, PS} &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

$$
\text{Banking System}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
 & \text{+ deposits, G} \\
 & \text{- deposits, PS} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The T-accounts above illustrate the impact of selling bonds. The bonds become the government's liability in exchange for deposit accounts in the banking system which can then be used for buying war goods. The private sector gets these bonds as an asset but lowers its own deposits with the bank. The government can now use these deposits to buy war goods from the private sector. The issue with this operation is that the private sector may not buy the bonds as it finds the interest rate undesirable, so it might be better to bypass the private sector and get a loan directly from the banking system.

\begin{array}{|c|c|}

\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\

\text{+ deposits, G} & \text{+ loans} \\

This swap of IOUs is more simply an expansion of the balance sheet on both sides. Salmon P. Chase, then Secretary of the Treasury, did precisely what is illustrated above. However, instead of using this loan to buy war goods from the private sector, he withdrew all of them in 1861. He withdrew them but demanded payment in gold. At this point the gold standard still existed. Chase did this because all international payments required gold and he intended to buy war goods not domestically, but from abroad. This was considered a stroke of genius on his part because it allowed the North to continue acquiring goods from abroad by making payments in gold whereas the South suffered and had to rely on bartering with their cotton to acquire goods. Considered key to the North's success. Another implication was that it effectively took all the gold out of the banking system which meant banks had to suspend specie payments.

Chase also authorized the use of legal tenders, not backed by gold, that entered into the system as follows:

$$
\text{Govt.}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
\text{+ war goods} & \text{+ legal tenders} \\
 & \text{\$400 M} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

$$
\text{Private Sector}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
\text{- war goods} &  \\
\text{+ legal tenders} &  \\
\text{\$400 M} &  \\
\text{- legal tenders} &  \\
\text{\$100 M} &  \\
\text{+ deposits, PS} &  \\
\text{\$100 M} & \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

$$
\text{Banking System}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Assets} & \textbf{Liabilities} \\
\hline
\text{+ 100 M legal tenders} & \text{+ 100 M deposits, PS} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The government issues legal tenders as their liability and buys war goods. Legal tenders amounting to \$400 million enter the private sector. Suppose that around \$100 million are the excess and the private sector decides to deposit these into the banking system. This gives the banks legal tenders as their asset and creates a deposit account for the private sector. Bank deposits now become promises to pay legal tender. The legal tenders were understood to be redeemable for gold later, but over the course of the war, their value depreciated against gold. Additionally, the prices of domestic goods also rose. Only many years after the war concluded, were legal tenders retired by an exchange with gold which brought the parity to prewar levels. I discuss the National Banking System in my next post.
